# Topological Indices - Molecular Structure Analysis

This project calculates three topological indices for molecular structures: **Edge Density**, **Wiener Index**, and **PetitJean Index**. The program supports different input formats and calculates the selected indices for a given molecule or set of molecules. The project implements these calculations from scratch using fundamental graph operations, without relying on pre-built functions for computing topological indices.
